# Algorithm Demonstration

Interactive visualization of sorting algorithms.

## Features

- Visualize popular sorting algorithms including Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort
- Interactive controls to adjust sorting speed and array size
- Clean and intuitive user interface

## Algorithms Implemented

1. **Bubble Sort** - A simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
2. **Selection Sort** - An in-place comparison sorting algorithm that divides the input list into a sorted and an unsorted region.
3. **Insertion Sort** - A simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time.
4. **Merge Sort** - An efficient, stable, divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm.
5. **Quick Sort** - An efficient sorting algorithm that uses a divide-and-conquer approach.
