# Algorithm Demonstration

This project is a sorting algorithm visualization tool designed to demonstrate how different sorting algorithms work. It provides an interactive visualization of classic sorting algorithms including Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Quick Sort, and Merge Sort.

## Features

- Visualization of 5 classic sorting algorithms
- Interactive controls for algorithm selection
- Adjustable data size and sorting speed
- Performance statistics (comparisons, swaps, execution time)
- Multiple data set types (random, sorted, reverse sorted, etc.)

## Algorithms Implemented

1. **Bubble Sort** - A simple comparison-based algorithm
2. **Selection Sort** - An in-place comparison sorting algorithm
3. **Insertion Sort** - A simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time
4. **Quick Sort** - An efficient divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm
5. **Merge Sort** - An efficient, stable, comparison-based, divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm
